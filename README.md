FreeSign is an eSignature app, an open-source alternative to DocuSign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign etc. We offer a hosted version at [signpdfonline.com](https://signpdfonline.com/).

## Features

- **Sign PDF online** -The signature service is a legally binding electronic signature solution with robust processes. Each signed document comes with audit trail that provides proof of document access, review, and signature.
- **Secure & Reliable** -Safely sign and request signatures for your most important documents. All communication with our online signature tool is safely protected using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. Your data is encrypted and saved on our secured servers. We guarantee the privacy of your documents and electronic signatures.
- **In-person Sign** -With In-Person signing, you can render the signable documents on your device, skipping the need to send the agreement via email. If you are meeting in person with someone, you can use In-Person Signing to simplify the signing process.
- **Reusable Templates** -Save time and standardize processes by storing frequently used documents and their custom fields.
- **Bulk Sign** -Bulk Sign allows you to send one document to many people at the same time. Simply import a list of recipients, and each one will receive a unique copy of the document to sign â€” eliminating the need to create and send separate envelopes.
- **Custom Fields** -Add standard fields to your documents like a signature or date, or create and save custom fields with different fonts, colors or other styles.
